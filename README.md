# üçî The Cookout

## Description
If you‚Äôve ever hosted a cookout and been responsible for the grill, you know the challenge:  
How much do you need to cook, and how much of each item?

Today, cookouts are often planned through scattered text messages, Facebook groups, and other platforms. But none of these pull everything together to ensure you have everything you need for a successful event.

The Cookout is a web application designed for both hosts and attendees. With this app, people can better organize, plan, and manage the actual cooking of food, while tracking what everyone wants to make sure all attendees get their meals and enjoy a great time.
