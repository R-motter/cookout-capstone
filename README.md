If you’ve ever hosted a cookout and ever responsible for the grill, you’ve seen the challenge of how much you need to cook up and how much of each item.

Today, cookouts are planned via text message, facebook groups, and other forms of technology but none of these pull everything together to ensure you have everything you need for a successful cookout.

This application will be designed for people who are hosting and attending cookouts. Through the use of this application, people will be able to better organize, plan, and manage the actual cooking of the food and tracking what everyone wants to make sure that all attendees get their meals and have a good time.
